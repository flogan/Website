            I am a senior computer science student at UMass Amherst on the 
            search for a start to my software development carrer. With the possibilities
            of tech becoming more and more endless, I am excited to make my mark in 
            the field.

                <h3>Data Analyst at Office of Waste Management</h3>
                <p> At the Office of Waste Management of UMass, a campus of 
                    over 25,000, we produce a lot of refuse - and a lot of data. 
                    It is my duty to gather, scrub, and maintain data stores of collection
                    truck weights and locations. I use this data with different technologies
                    like ArcGIS and excel to perfrom different analysies to better inform, and improve, the 
                    campus' sustainability efforts.
