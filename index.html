                        truck weights and locations. I use this data with different technologies
                        like ArcGIS and excel to perfrom different analysies to better inform, and improve, the

                    <h3>Professional Breeder Book Keeping</h3>
                    <p>My mom breeds standard poodles for a living and is an entrepreneur turning it into a full business. However, none of her files 
                        are digital, and there is a lot of paperwork that comes with the field. There are contracts signed with the sale of a puppy, vet records,
                        microchip numbers, pedigrees, etc. Whenever my mother needs a piece of information that isn't readily available she has to flip through massive
                        binders to locate a document. The idea here would be to digitize records and scan documents to be able to search by dog or customer to 
                        quickly obtain records, created connections between dogs like parents and breeding offspring to quickly access important information.

                <div>
                    <h3>Is This Recyclable? App</h3>
                    <p>The idea would be to create an app for UMass students which utilizes AI and image recognition to tell users if an image they take of 
                        a piece of waste is either recyclable, compostable or must be put in the trash at UMass. This idea came from trying to increase 
                        recycling participation after seeing the recycling rate numbers.
                    </p>
