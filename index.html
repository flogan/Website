            I am a senior computer science student at UMass Amherst on the 
            search for a start to my software development carrer. With the possibilities
            of tech becoming increasingly endless, I am excited to make my mark in 
            the field.

                <h3>Data Analyst at Office of Waste Management</h3>
                <p> At the Office of Waste Management of UMass, a campus of 
                    over 25,000, we produce a lot of refuse - and a lot of data. 
                    It is my duty to gather, scrub, and maintain data stores of collection
                    truck weights and locations. I use this data with different technologies
                    like ArcGIS and excel to perfrom different analysies to better inform, and improve, the 
                    campus' sustainability efforts.

            <h3>Ideas</h3>
            <div>
                <h4>Professional Breeder Book Keeping</h4>
                <p>My mom breeds standard poodles for a living and is an entrepreneur turning it into a full business. However, none of her files 
                    are digital, and there is a lot of paperwork that comes with the feild. There are contracts signed with the sale of a puppy, vet records,
                    microchip numbers, pedigrees, etc. Whenever my mother needs a piece of information that isn't readily available she has to flip through massive
                    binders to locate a document. The idea here would be to digitize records and scan documents to be able to search by dog or customer to 
                    quickly obtain records, created connections between dogs like parents and breeding offspring to quickly access important information.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4>Is This Recyclable? App</h4>
                <p>The idea would be to create an app for UMass students which utilizes AI and image recognition to tell users if an image they take of 
                    a piece of waste is either recyclable, compostable or must be put in the trash at UMass. This idea came from trying to increase 
                    recycling participation after seeing the recycling rate numbers.
                </p>
